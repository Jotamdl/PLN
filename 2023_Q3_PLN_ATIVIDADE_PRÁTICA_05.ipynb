According to the ACM Europe Council and Informatics Europe, informatics is synonymous with computer science and computing as a profession, in which the central notion is transformation of information. In some cases, the term \"informatics\" may also be used with different meanings, e.g. in the context of social computing, or in context of library science.', 'Text': '\\nDifferent meanings\\nIn some countries, depending on local interpretations, the term \"informatics\" is used synonymously to mean information systems, information science, information theory, information engineering, information technology, information processing, or other theoretical or practical fields. In Germany, the term informatics almost exactly corresponds to modern computer science. Accordingly, universities in continental Europe usually translate \"informatics\" as computer science, or sometimes information and computer science, although technical universities may translate it as computer science & engineering.In the United States, however, the term informatics is mostly used in context of data science, library science or its applications in healthcare (health informatics), where it first appeared in the US.\\nThe University of Washington uses this term to refer to social computing. In some countries, this term is associated with natural computation and neural computation.The Government of Canada uses the term to refer to operational units offering network and computer services to the various departments.\\n\\nEtymology\\nIn 1956, the German informatician Karl Steinbuch and engineer Helmut Gröttrup coined the word Informatik when they developed the Informatik-Anlage for the Quelle mail-order management, one of the earliest commercial applications of data processing. In April 1957, Steinbuch published a paper called Informatik: Automatische Informationsverarbeitung (\"Informatics: Automatic Information Processing\"). The morphology—informat-ion + -ics—uses \"the accepted form for names of sciences, as conics, mathematics, linguistics, optics, or matters of practice, as economics, politics, tactics\", and so, linguistically, the meaning extends easily to encompass both the science of information and the practice of information processing. The German word Informatik is usually translated to English as computer science by universities or computer science & engineering by technical universities (German equivalents for institutes of technology). Depending on the context, informatics is also translated into computing, scientific computing or information and computer technology. The French term informatique was coined in 1962 by Philippe Dreyfus. In the same month was also proposed independently by Walter F. Bauer (1924–2015) and associates who co-founded software company Informatics Inc. The term for the new discipline quickly spread throughout Europe, but it did not catch on in the United States. Over the years, many different definitions of informatics have been developed, most of them claim that the essence of informatics is one of these concepts: information processing, algorithms, computation, information, algorithmic processes, computational processes or computational systems.\\n\\nThe earliest uses of the term informatics in the United States was during the 1950s with the beginning of computer use in healthcare.  Early practitioners interested in the field soon learned that there were no formal education programs, and none emerged until the late 1960s. They introduced the term informatics only in the context of archival science, which is only a small part of informatics. Professional development, therefore, played a significant role in the development of health informatics. According to Imhoff et al., 2001, healthcare informatics is not only the application of computer technology to problems in healthcare, but covers all aspects of generation, handling, communication, storage, retrieval, management, analysis, discovery, and synthesis of data information and knowledge in the entire scope of healthcare. Furthermore, they stated that the primary goal of health informatics can be distinguished as follows: To provide solutions for problems related to data, information, and knowledge processing. To study general principles of processing data information and knowledge in medicine and healthcare. The term health informatics quickly spread throughout the United States in various forms such as nursing informatics, public health informatics ', 'Categories': {'Category:Articles with hatnote templates targeting a nonexistent page': Category:Articles with hatnote templates targeting a nonexistent page (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with short description': Category:Articles with short description (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:CS1 German-language sources (de)': Category:CS1 German-language sources (de) (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:CS1 maint: location missing publisher': Category:CS1 maint: location missing publisher (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Cognitive science': Category:Cognitive science (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Computational fields of study': Category:Computational fields of study (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Computer science education': Category:Computer science education (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Information science': Category:Information science (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Schools of informatics': Category:Schools of informatics (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata': Category:Short description is different from Wikidata (id: ??, ns: 14)}}, 'cooking': {'Title': 'Cuisine', 'Summary': 'A cuisine  is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques and dishes, and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. Regional food preparation techniques, customs, and ingredients combine to enable dishes unique to a region.', 'Text': '\\nEtymology\\nUsed in English since the late 18th century, the word cuisine – meaning manner or style of cooking – is borrowed from the French for \"style of cooking\", as originally derived from Latin coquere \"to cook\".\\n\\nInfluences on cuisine\\nA cuisine is partly determined by ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Regional ingredients are developed and commonly contribute to a regional or national cuisine, such as Japanese rice in Japanese cuisine.\\nReligious food laws can also exercise an influence on cuisine, such as Indian cuisine and Hinduism that is mainly lacto-vegetarian (avoiding meat and eggs) due to sacred animal worship. Sikhism in Punjabi cuisine, Buddhism in East Asian cuisine, Christianity in European cuisine, Islam in Middle Eastern cuisine, and Judaism in Jewish and Israeli cuisine all exercise an influence on cuisine.\\nSome factors that have an influence on a region\\'s cuisine include the area\\'s climate, the trade among different countries, religious or sumptuary laws and culinary culture exchange. For example, a tropical diet may be based more on fruits and vegetables, while a polar diet might rely more on meat and fish.\\nThe area\\'s climate, in large measure, determines the native foods that are available. In addition, climate influences food preservation. For example, foods preserved for winter consumption by smoking, curing, and pickling have remained significant in world cuisines for their altered gustatory properties.\\nThe trade among different countries also largely affects a region\\'s cuisine. Dating back to the ancient spice trade, seasonings such as cinnamon, cassia, cardamom, ginger, and turmeric were important items of commerce in the earliest evolution of trade, and India was a global market for this. Cinnamon and cassia found their way to the Middle East at least 4,000 years ago.Certain foods and food preparations are required or proscribed by the religiousness or sumptuary laws, such as Islamic dietary laws and Jewish dietary laws.\\nCulinary culture exchange is also an important factor for cuisine in many regions: Japan\\'s first substantial and direct exposure to the West came with the arrival of European missionaries in the second half of the 16th century. At that time, the combination of Spanish and Portuguese game frying techniques with an East Asian method for cooking vegetables in oil, led to the development of tempura, the \"popular Japanese dish in which seafood and many different types of vegetables are coated with batter and deep fried\".\\n\\nHistory\\nCuisine dates back to  Antiquity. As food began to require more planning, there was an emergence of meals that situated around culture.\\n\\nEvolution of cuisine\\nCuisines evolve continually, and new cuisines are created by innovation and cultural interaction. One recent example is fusion cuisine, which combines elements of various culinary traditions while not being categorized per any one cuisine style, and generally refers to the innovations in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s. Nouvelle cuisine (New cuisine) is an approach to cooking and food presentation in French cuisine that was popularized in the 1960s by the food critics Henri Gault, who invented the phrase, and his colleagues André Gayot and Christian Millau in a new restaurant guide, the Gault-Millau, or Le Nouveau Guide. Molecular cuisine, is a modern style of cooking which takes advantage of many technical innovations from the scientific disciplines (molecular cooking). The term was coined in 1999 by the French INRA chemist Hervé . This because he wanted to distinguish it from the name Molecular gastronomy (a scientific activity) that was  introduced by him and the late Oxford physicist Nicholas Kurti in 1988. It is also named as multi sensory cooking, modernist cuisine, culinary physics, and experimental cuisine by some chefs. Besides, international trade brings new foodstuffs including ingredients to existing cuisines and leads to changes.

Races of various sorts were organised, with the first recorded as early as 1867. Many of the earliest events were effectively reliability trials, aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport, but soon became an important way for automobile makers to demonstrate their machines. By the 1930s, specialist racing cars had developed.\\nThere are now numerous different categories, each with different rules and regulations.', 'Text': '\\nHistory\\nThe first prearranged match race of two self-powered road vehicles over a prescribed route occurred at 4:30 A.M. on August 30, 1867, between Ashton-under-Lyne and Old Trafford, England, a distance of 8 mi (13 km). It was won by the carriage of Isaac Watt Boulton.Internal combustion auto racing events began soon after the construction of the first successful gasoline-fueled automobiles. The first organized contest was on April 28, 1887, by the chief editor of Paris publication Le Vélocipède, Monsieur Fossier. It ran 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from Neuilly Bridge to the Bois de Boulogne.\\nOn July 22, 1894, the Parisian magazine Le Petit Journal organized what is considered to be the world\\'s first motoring competition, from Paris to Rouen. One hundred and two competitors paid a 10-franc entrance fee.The first American automobile race is generally held to be the Thanksgiving Day Chicago Times-Herald race of November 28, 1895. Press coverage of the event first aroused significant American interest in the automobile.The Targa Florio was an open road endurance automobile race held in the mountains of Sicily, Italy near the island\\'s capital of Palermo. Founded in 1906, it was the oldest sports car racing event, part of the World Sportscar Championship between 1955 and 1973.\\nThe oldest surviving sports car racing event is the 24 Hours of Le Mans, begun in 1923. It is run by the Automobile Club of the West (ACO). Team Ferrari won the race in 2023. \\nWith auto construction and racing dominated by France, the French automobile club ACF staged a number of major international races, usually from or to Paris, connecting with another major city, in France or elsewhere in Europe.\\nAspendale Racecourse, in Australia, was the world\\'s first purpose-built motor racing circuit, opening in January 1906. The pear-shaped track was close to a mile in length, with slightly banked curves and a gravel surface of crushed cement.\\nBrooklands, in Surrey, England, was the first purpose-built \\'banked\\' motor racing venue, opening in June 1907. It featured a 4.43 km (2.75 mi) concrete track with high-speed banked corners.\\nOne of the oldest existing purpose-built automobile racing circuits in the United States, still in use, is the 2.5-mile-long (4.0 km) Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. It is the largest capacity sports venue of any variety worldwide, with a top capacity of some 257,000+ seated spectators.NASCAR was founded by Bill France Sr. on February 21, 1948, with the help of several other drivers of the time. The first NASCAR \"Strictly Stock\" race ever was held on June 19, 1949, at Daytona Beach, Florida, U.S..\\nFrom 1962, sports cars temporarily took a back seat to GT cars, with the Fédération Internationale de l\\'Automobile (FIA) replacing the World Championship for Sports Cars with the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.From 1962 through 2003, NASCAR\\'s premier series was called the Winston Cup Series, sponsored by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company cigarette brand Winston. The changes that resulted from RJR\\'s involvement, as well as the reduction of the schedule from 56 to 34 races a year, established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR\\'s \"modern era\".\\nThe IMSA GT Series evolved into the American Le Mans Series, which ran its first season in 1998. The European races eventually became the closely related European Le Mans Series, both of which mix prototypes and GTs.\\nTurismo Carretera (TC) is a popular touring car racing series in Argentina, and one of the oldest car racing series still active in the world.

Ecology considers organisms at the individual, population, community, ecosystem, and biosphere level. Ecology overlaps with the closely related sciences of biogeography, evolutionary biology, genetics, ethology, and natural history. \\nEcology is a branch of biology, and is the study of abundance, biomass, and distribution of organisms in the context of the environment. It encompasses life processes, interactions, and adaptations; movement of materials and energy through living communities; successional development of ecosystems; cooperation, competition, and predation within and between species; and patterns of biodiversity and its effect on ecosystem processes.\\nEcology has practical applications in conservation biology, wetland management, natural resource management (agroecology, agriculture, forestry, agroforestry, fisheries, mining, tourism), urban planning (urban ecology), community health, economics, basic and applied science, and human social interaction (human ecology).\\nThe word ecology (German: Ökologie) was coined in 1866 by the German scientist Ernst Haeckel. The science of ecology as we know it today began with a group of American botanists in the 1890s. Evolutionary concepts relating to adaptation and natural selection are cornerstones of modern ecological theory.\\nEcosystems are dynamically interacting systems of organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living (abiotic) components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, nutrient cycling, and niche construction, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. Ecosystems have biophysical feedback mechanisms that moderate processes acting on living (biotic) and abiotic components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain life-supporting functions and provide ecosystem services like biomass production (food, fuel, fiber, and medicine), the regulation of climate, global biogeochemical cycles, water filtration, soil formation, erosion control, flood protection, and many other natural features of scientific, historical, economic, or intrinsic value.\", 'Text': '\\nLevels, scope, and scale of organization\\nThe scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Because ecosystems are dynamic and don\\'t necessarily follow a linear successional route, changes might occur quickly or slowly over thousands of years before specific forest successional stages are brought about by biological processes.. An ecosystem\\'s area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but is critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, supports diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.The main subdisciplines of ecology, population (or community) ecology and ecosystem ecology, exhibit a difference not only in scale but also in two contrasting paradigms in the field. The former focuses on organisms\\' distribution and abundance, while the latter focuses on materials and energy fluxes.\\n\\nHierarchy\\nThe scale of ecological dynamics can operate like a closed system, such as aphids migrating on a single tree, while at the same time remaining open with regard to broader scale influences, such as atmosphere or climate. Hence, ecologists classify ecosystems hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types, and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional, landscape, and chronological scales.\\nTo structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework, the biological world is organized into a nested hierarchy, ranging in scale from genes, to cells, to tissues, to organs, to organisms, to species, to populations, to communities, to ecosystems, to biomes, and up to the level of the biosphere. This framework forms a panarchy and exhibits non-linear behaviors; this means that \"effect and cause are disproportionate, so that small changes to critical variables, such as the number of nitrogen fixers, can lead to disproportionate, perhaps irreversible, changes in the system properties.\":\\u200a14\\n\\nBiodiversity\\nBiodiversity (an abbreviation of \"biological diversity\") describes the diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several interpretations, and there are many ways to index, measure, characterize, and represent its complex organization. Biodiversity includes species diversity, ecosystem diversity, and genetic diversity and scientists are interested in the way that this diversity affects the complex ecological processes operating at and among these respective levels. Biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem services which by definition maintain and improve human quality of life. Conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches and considerations to address the full ecological scope of biodiversity. Natural capital that supports populations is critical for maintaining ecosystem services and species migration (e.g., riverine fish runs and avian insect control) has been implicated as one mechanism by which those service losses are experienced. An understanding of biodiversity has practical app', 'Categories': {'Category:All articles with unsourced statements': Category:All articles with unsourced statements (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text': Category:Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles containing German-language text': Category:Articles containing German-language text (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with BNE identifiers': Category:Articles with BNE identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with BNF identifiers': Category:Articles with BNF identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with BNFdata identifiers': Category:Articles with BNFdata identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with EMU identifiers': Category:Articles with EMU identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with GND identifiers': Category:Articles with GND identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with HDS identifiers': Category:Articles with HDS identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with J9U identifiers': Category:Articles with J9U identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with LCCN identifiers': Category:Articles with LCCN identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with LNB identifiers': Category:Articles with LNB identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with NARA identifiers': Category:Articles with NARA identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with NDL identifiers': Category:Articles with NDL identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with NKC identifiers': Category:Articles with NKC identifiers (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with excerpts': Category:Articles with excerpts (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with short description': Category:Articles with short description (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from December 2022': Category:Articles with unsourced statements from December 2022 (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Biogeochemistry': Category:Biogeochemistry (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:CS1 German-language sources (de)': Category:CS1 German-language sources (de) (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Ecology': Category:Ecology (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Ecology terminology': Category:Ecology terminology (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Emergence': Category:Emergence (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Good articles': Category:Good articles (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Pages using Sister project links with default search': Category:Pages using Sister project links with default search (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata': Category:Short description is different from Wikidata (id: ??, ns: 14), 'Category:Use dmy dates from January 2020': Category:Use dmy dates from January 2020 (id: ??, ns: 14)}}}\n"

Below is a revised version of the new summary with major adjustments to include additional information where it differs from the original summary. \\n\\nInformatics is a broad term that encompasses multiple meanings in various contexts. While Germany interprets informatics as modern computer science, the United States often relates it to data science, library science, or health informatics in specific industries. The term can also refer to operational units providing network and computer services in Canada. Karl Steinbuch and Helmut Gr\\u00f6ttrup coined the term \\\"informatics\\\" in 1956, and Steinbuch further popularized it with the publication of \\\"Informatik: Automatische Informationsverarbeitung.\\\" \\n\\nOver time, various definitions of informatics have emerged, but most interpretations emphasize information processing, algorithms, computation, information, algorithmic processes, computational processes, or computational systems as the core of informatics. The use of the term in the 1950s, particularly in the healthcare industry, predated the establishment of educational programs in the field, which emerged only in the late 1960s.

            "    \"Cuisine\": \" Similarity: 92%\\n\\nHere is a revised version of the summary with some changes to increase the word count and include additional information:\\n\\nCuisine is a term used to describe a particular style of cooking that is associated with a specific culture or geographic region. Several factors influence the cuisine of a region, including locally available ingredients, trade, religious food laws, and climate. \\n\\nReligious food laws, observed by various religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, greatly influence cuisines worldwide. These laws can prohibit certain foods, such as pork or beef, and require others, like dairy or fish. This leads to the development of specific cuisines like Jewish cuisine, Indian cuisine, and Thai cuisine, which are unique to their respective religious traditions. \\n\\nThe climate of a region also plays a crucial role in determining its cuisine. For example, a tropical climate is ideal for growing spices, which leads to spicy cuisines in tropical areas. Additionally, a cold climate might limit the availability of fresh produce, resulting in the reliance on preserved foods like pickles and jams.\\n\\nTrade has introduced new ingredients and flavors to cuisines worldwide, especially in the ancient spice trade. Fusion cuisine, which combines elements from different culinary traditions, is an example of how cultures have influenced each other through trade and innovation. \\n\\nOverall, cuisines are dynamic and constantly evolving, reflecting the interaction between culture, geography, and history. \\n\\nWould you like more assistance with summarizing? \",\n",

Races of various sorts were organized, with the first recorded as early as 1867. Many of these earliest events were effectively reliability trials, aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport, but soon became an important way for automobile makers to demonstrate their machines. By the 1930s, specialist racing cars had developed. There are now numerous different categories, each with different rules and regulations.\\n\\nThe history of auto racing extends back to the mid-19th century, with the first prearranged match race of two self-powered road vehicles occurring in England in 1867. Since then, auto racing has grown in popularity, with several notable racing events and circuits emerging over the years.\\n\\nSome of the most significant events in the history of auto racing include:\\n\\n1. The Targa Florio: This was an open road endurance automobile race held in Sicily, Italy, which began in 1906 and was part of the World Sportscar Championship between 1955 and 1973. \\n\\n2. The 24 Hours of Le Mans: This is the oldest surviving sports car racing event, which began in 1923 and is run by the Automobile Club of the West (ACO). \\n\\n3. The Thanksgiving Day Chicago Times-Herald Race: This is considered the first American automobile race and helped to spark significant interest in the automobile in the US. \\n\\n4. Aspendale Racecourse in Australia: This was the first purpose-built motor racing circuit and opened in 1906. \\n\\n5. Brooklands in Surrey, England: This was the first purpose-built 'banked' motor racing venue and opened in 1907. \\n\\n6. Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indiana, US: This is one of the oldest existing purpose-built automobile racing circuits and is still in use today. It has the largest capacity of any sports venue worldwide. The track at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is also known as the Brickyard, due to the fact that the track surface was originally made of bricks. \\n\\n7. The Formation of NASCAR: NASCAR, or the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, was founded in 1948 by Bill France Sr., and the first NASCAR \\\"Strictly Stock\\\" race\",\n",
            "    \"Ecology\": \" Here is a rewritten version of the text you provided with a similarity of less than 80% to the original text:\\n\\nThe study of ecology examines the intricate relationships between living organisms and their environment, from the individual to the planetary level. It involves analyzing ecosystems, which are dynamic communities of organisms and their physical surroundings. Ecology considers the interactions between various living organisms and their environment, including the impact of human activities on ecosystems.\\n\\nEcology examines the organization of living organisms using a hierarchical framework, ranging from genes to species, populations, communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere. This framework helps understand the complex relationships between different levels of biological organization and their impact on the environment. Within this hierarchy, population and community ecology are significant subdisciplines that focus on the population dynamics and interactions within ecosystems.\\n\\nThe diversity of life forms, known as biodiversity, is a crucial aspect of ecological systems. It encompasses the variety of species, ecosystems, and genes and plays a vital role in maintaining ecosystem services that benefit both the natural environment and human well-being. Understanding biodiversity is essential for conservation efforts and managing ecological systems to ensure the preservation of natural capital and species migration patterns.\\n\\nThe study of ecology follows certain principles, such as the idea that the birth rate of a population can be determined by adding up the individual births over a specific period. Additionally, it recognizes the scale of ecological dynamics, which can operate within a specific context while also being influenced by broader scale factors.\\n\\nIn conclusion, ecology is a diverse field that examines the relationships between living organisms and their environment, using a hierarchical framework to understand different levels of organization and the concept of biodiversity. The study of ecology is crucial for preserving and understanding the complex web of life on Earth, and for informing decisions regarding the management and conservation of natural resources. \\n\\nWould you like me to rephrase this summary? \"\n",

Design refers to something that is or has been intentionally created by a thinking agent, though it is sometimes used to refer to the nature of something. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan may also be considered to be a design (such as in some artwork and craftwork). The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints; may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations; and is expected to interact with a certain environment. Typical examples of designs include architectural and engineering drawings, circuit diagrams, sewing patterns and less tangible artefacts such as business process models.'}, 'Automobile industry': {'Title': 'Car', 'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car', 'Summary': \"A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo. French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808.\\nThe modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II. The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.\\nCars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025. The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies. There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries.\"}, 'Technology': {'Title': 'Information technology', 'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology', 'Summary': 'Information technology (IT) is a set of related fields that encompass computer systems, software, programming languages and data and information processing and storage. IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users, and an IT project usually refers to the commissioning and implementation of an IT system.Although humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the earliest writing systems were developed, the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that \"the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT).\" Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce.Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC — 1450 AD), mechanical (1450 — 1840), electromechanical (1840 — 1940), and electronic (1940 to present).Information technology is also a branch of computer science, which can be defined as the overall study of procedure, structure, and the processing of various types of data.  As this field continues to evolve across the world, its overall priority and importance has also grown, which is where we begin to see the introduction of computer science-related courses in K-12 education.'}, 'Mathematics': {'Title': 'Calculus', 'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus', 'Summary': 'Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape, and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.\\nOriginally called infinitesimal calculus or \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", it has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus. The former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while the latter concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Later work, including codifying the idea of limits, put these developments on a more solid conceptual footing. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and social science.'}, 'Art': {'Title': 'Painting', 'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting', 'Summary': 'Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the \"matrix\" or \"support\"). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.\\nIn art, the term \"painting\" describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called \"a painting\"). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects.\\nPainting is an important form of visual art, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture, narration, and abstraction. Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still life and landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism).\\nA portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art. Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).'}}\n"

(; Italian: [ferˈraːri]) is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898–1988), the company built its first car in 1940, adopted its current name in 1945, and began to produce its current line of road cars in 1947. Ferrari became a public company in 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's successor entity, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2016.\\nThe company currently offers a large model range which includes several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV. Many early Ferraris, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, count among the most expensive cars ever sold at auction. Owing to a combination of its cars, enthusiast culture, and successful licensing deals, in 2019 Ferrari was labelled the world's strongest brand by the financial consultency Brand Finance. As of May 2023 Ferrari is also one of the largest car manufacturers by market capitalisation, with a value of approximately US$52 billion.Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where its team, Scuderia Ferrari, is the series' single oldest and most successful. Scuderia Ferrari has raced since 1929, first in Grand Prix events and later in Formula One, where since 1952 it has fielded fifteen champion drivers, won sixteen Constructors' Championships, and accumulated more race victories, 1–2 finishes, podiums, pole positions, fastest laps and points than any other team in F1 history. Historically, Ferrari was also highly active in sports car racing, where its cars took many wins in races like the Mille Miglia, Targa Florio and 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as several overall victories in the World Sportscar Championship. Scuderia Ferrari fans, commonly called tifosi, are known for their passion and loyalty to the team.\"}, 'Mercedes-benz': {'Title': 'Mercedes-Benz', 'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz', 'Summary': 'Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation: [mɛʁˌtseːdəs ˈbɛnts, -dɛs -] ), commonly referred to as Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926.

The privately owned company was founded by Bill France Sr. in 1948, and his son, Jim France, has been the CEO since August 2018. The company is headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. Each year, NASCAR sanctions over 1,500 races at over 100 tracks in 48 US states as well as in Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Europe.\\nNASCAR, and stock car racing as a whole, traces its roots back to moonshine runners during prohibition, who grew to compete against each other in a show of pride. This happened notably in North Carolina. In 1935, Bill France Sr. established races in Daytona Beach, with the hope that people would come to watch races, and that racers would race for him, as other organizers tended to fleece the winners of their payouts. This was a success, and the series was founded in 1948. Races were held in several divisions, which eventually morphed into what is the \"ladder:\" the Cup Series at the top, the Xfinity Series second, and the Truck Series third, with smaller series spread out below. Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota compete in each series.\\nThe vast majority of NASCAR drivers are American, but drivers from Canada, Mexico, Europe, and other places have competed. All Cup Series races are held across America. There are 36 points-paying races in a season, along with the pre-season Clash and mid-season All-Star race. NASCAR runs races primarily on ovals, including superspeedways, short tracks, and dirt tracks, but also road courses and street circuits.\\nRichard Petty holds the Cup Series wins record with 200, and ties with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson for the championship record, with seven each.
